BOOM Core with RISC-V Vector Extension
====================================================================================================================================================================

[More info on BOOM](https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom)
This fork is used to explore the [Downfall](https://downfall.page/) and [Zenbleed](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html) attacks by recreating them on a RISC-V.


## IMPORTANT: Using BOOM
This repository is **NOT A SELF-RUNNING** repository. To instantiate a BOOM core, please use the
[Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) SoC generator.
